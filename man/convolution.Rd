\item{A}{A numeric vector or matrix.}

\item{A}{B numeric vector or matrix.}
}
\description{
If A (or B) is a numeric vector, it is converted into a one-column 
matrix. Then if A and B do not have the same number of column, then the 
first column of the matrix with the smallest number of column is repeated to
match the dimension of the other matrix.
